################################ AMBER #######################################

# First we'll make sure AMBERHOME is set. If AMBERHOME isn't set, it's unlikely 
# that the libraries can be found, regardless of whether cpptraj/pmemd exist 
# in the path.
#if [[ -z "$AMBERHOME" ]]; then
#  echo "AMBERHOME environment variable is not set."
#  echo "Source amber.sh, or modify env.sh so that WESTPA knows where AMBER is."
#  exit
#fi

# Next, set environment variables for pmemd and cpptraj. This is good practice
# for running WESTPA simulations on clusters, as repeatedly calling "pmemd" or
# "cpptraj" rather than the absolute path to these binaries (e.g.,
# "/usr/local/amber/bin/pmemd") can take a long time and be harder on the
# filesystem.  For this tutorial, this step is not necessary but nonetheless
# demonstrates good practice.
#export PMEMD=$(which pmemd)
#export CPPTRAJ=$(which cpptraj)

############################## Python and WESTPA ###############################
# Next inform WESTPA what python it should use.  
export WEST_PYTHON=$(which python2.7)

# Check to make sure that the environment variable WEST_ROOT is set. 
# Here, the code '[ -z "$WEST_ROOT"]' will return TRUE if WEST_ROOT is not set,
# causing us to enter the if-statement, print an error message, and exit.
if [ -z "$WEST_ROOT" ]; then
  echo "The environment variable WEST_ROOT is not set."
  echo "Try running 'source westpa.sh' from the WESTPA installation directory"
  exit 1
fi

# Explicitly name our simulation root directory.  Similar to the statement 
# above, we check if the variable is not set.  If the variable is not set,
# the we set it 
if [ -z "$WEST_SIM_ROOT" ]; then
  export WEST_SIM_ROOT="$PWD"
fi

# Set the simulation name.  Whereas "WEST_SIM_ROOT" gives us the entire 
# absolute path to the simulation directory, running the "basename" command
# will give us only the last part of that path (the directory name).
export SIM_NAME=$(basename $WEST_SIM_ROOT)
